# Binary Search Tree Implementation for City Data Management

## Overview

This project involves the implementation of a balanced **Binary Search Tree (BST)** in C for managing a global city dataset. Developed in association with the Lebanese University from April 2021 to June 2021, the application efficiently handles large datasets by optimizing key operations to enhance data query speeds.

## Features

- **Balanced Binary Search Tree**: Maintains optimal operation times by ensuring the tree remains balanced.
- **Data Management**: Manages a comprehensive global city dataset sourced from a CSV file.
- **Optimized Operations**:
  - **Insertion, Deletion, Search**: Enhanced to improve data query speeds by at least 30%.
- **User Interface**:
  - **Command-Line Interface (CLI)**: Facilitates efficient reading and updating of the dataset.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Language**: C
- **Data Format**: CSV for dataset storage
- **Version Control**: Git & GitHub

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/bst-city-data-management.git
    ```

2. **Navigate to the Project Directory**:
    ```bash
    cd bst-city-data-management
    ```

3. **Compile the Code**:
    ```bash
    gcc -o bst main.c bst.c
    ```

4. **Run the Application**:
    ```bash
    ./bst
    ```

## Usage

Upon running the application, you can perform the following operations:

- **Insert a City**: Add a new city to the dataset.
- **Delete a City**: Remove an existing city from the dataset.
- **Search for a City**: Retrieve information about a specific city.
- **Update Dataset**: Modify existing city data.
